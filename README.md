## Python code for plot shown at end of my CS191 Video

I wanted to touch on how Fortran affected the approachibility of programming as a whole, but couldn't find a good graph online estimating number of programmers over time - thus I made my own.

My estimates were based on a combination of online research, GPT-4, and Microsoft's Bing AI. Once I had the estimates, I could just put them together using Matplotlib.
